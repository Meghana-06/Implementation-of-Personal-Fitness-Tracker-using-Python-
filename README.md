This project aims to develop a Personal Fitness Tracker using Python, enabling users to track their fitness metrics like steps, calories burned, and workout logs. The objective is to provide a user-friendly interface that helps individuals monitor their physical activities effectively.

The methodology involves Python programming, data visualization using Matplotlib/Seaborn, and optional integration with Google Fit API/Fitbit API for real-time data collection. The system is designed to analyze the userâ€™s progress and provide meaningful insights.

The implementation showcases a functional tracker where users can input their daily exercise data, view statistics, and set fitness goals. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using Python-based AI solutions in personal health tracking.
